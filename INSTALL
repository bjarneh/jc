Dependencies

* python
* bash-completion


======================================================
Install
======================================================

As super-user you have 2 choices:


    1. sudo make install
 *  2. make debian && sudo dpkg -i jc_v1.0_all.deb


As regular user you have 2 choices:

    1. copy bin/ag to some PATH location
    2. add $PWD/bin to your PATH variable.


* if you don't have a Debian based distro
  you can convert the deb to your distro with
  'alien', it's not ideal but it should work.


======================================================
RPM Distro
======================================================

If you have a RPM based system (RedHat/SuSE etc) use
alien to convert debian package to rpm.


make debian &&\
     sudo alien --to-rpm jc_v1.0_all.deb\
     sudo rpm -i jc-1.0-2.noarch.rpm
