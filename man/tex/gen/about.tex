\section{ About }

This is a small build tool for pure Java projects, similar to
 \href{http://ant.apache.org}{Ant} or  \href{http://maven.apache.org}{Maven},
but with no configuration for a typical setup.



\subsection{ Python }

It's written in  \href{http://python.org}{Python} and consists of
one file, such that it can be included as a Makefile with little 
or no additional setup.
